# Computational Photography / Patch Methods - Practical Works

This repository contains practical works (TPs) for the IMA206 course at Télécom Paris, focused on Computational Photography and Patch Methods.

## Course Description

IMA206 is divided into two main parts:

1. Methodological section focusing on:
   - Patch methods
   - Generative neural networks

2. Applications in computational photography, including:
   - High Dynamic Range (HDR) imaging
   - Image deconvolution
   - Inpainting

## Practical Works

This repository includes the following practical works:

1. TP1: Variational Autoencoders
2. TP2: Generative Adversarial Networks
3. TP3: Blur
